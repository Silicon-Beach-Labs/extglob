- Convert an extglob string to a regex-compatible string. 
- More complete (and correct) support than [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) (minimatch fails 25% of the extglob tests)
- Handles negation patterns
- Handles nested patterns
- As you can see by the [benchmarks](#benchmarks), extglob doesn't pay with speed for it's completeness, accuracy and quality.

**Heads up!**: This only converts extglobs, to handle full glob patterns and extglobs use [micromatch][] instead.

## Usage

The main export is a function that takes a string and options, and returns an object with the parsed AST and the compiled `.output`, which is a regex-compatible string that can be used for matching.

```js
var extglob = require('{%= name %}');
console.log(extglob('abc/!(xyz)*.js'));
```

## Extglob patterns

To learn more about how extglobs work, see the docs for [Bash pattern matching][bash]:

- `?(pattern)`: Match zero or one occurrence of the given pattern.
- `*(pattern)`: Match zero or more occurrences of the given pattern.
- `+(pattern)`: Match one or more occurrences of the given pattern.
- `@(pattern)`: Match one of the given pattern.
- `!(pattern)`: Match anything except one of the given pattern.
